Setting up Sphinx and VSCode on Windows.
========================================

This document describes how to get Sphinx-Doc running on a windows machine including the required software for editing, version control and building of the document package files.   It also goes into some detail on configuring this software and some basic conventions for RST documents editing.

A good, quick overview of Sphinx and how to set it up natively (using the OS python instead of a docker package) can be found at the following youtube `playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE72UCmIe7T9HewaqCUhKqiMK3LxYStjy>`_.

.. note::
   We will be using python provided by Docker - so our procedure is a little different.
