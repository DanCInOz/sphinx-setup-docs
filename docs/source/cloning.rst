Cloning and working with Repositories
=====================================

The idea of storing your documentation in a repo stems from two advantages.   Firstly of course you can track your changes.   But secondly, and perhaps more importantly, you can store the sources for docs in one place, and when a commit is made to the main branch, it can trigger a CI process to build the doc packages, and distribute them to wherever they are used.

This part of the documentation will describe a few tasks.

* How to clone a repository (we will use this one as an example) and set it up for visual studio.
* Build the documentation (html and pdf) from these sources.
* Make changes, and commit these back to our local repository.
* Create a pull request to send to the repo owner to accept changes.
* Create our own repo and start a fresh sphinx documentation project.
