Editing Sphinx documents
========================

By this stage you should have the following:

* A working git installation.
* Rancher and Docker engine so you can run the Sphinx python code.
* Visual Studio installed with a few useful plugins.
* A forked and cloned copy of the repository for this documentation package.

The docs are just sources.   There's no HTML or PDF yet.   So lets build that.

But first, I'll describe the directory structure of the Sphinx repo and a little info on the files and some settings..

What's in the repo?
