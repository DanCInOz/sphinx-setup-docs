Method 3 - Github workflows
===========================

One of the nice things we can do with github is to get it to compile our sources on github's own servers.   We can create a docker container in the guthub infrastructure and let it do what we want.   It can compile our pdf and html documentation each time we push our changes.   The actual build process is a little like what is described in Method 2, only it all happens in the cloud.
